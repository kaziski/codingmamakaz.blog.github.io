* Getting a conference ticket

In less than a year, I attended React Conf in Las Vegas, Ruby Conf in Los Angeles, Google Women Techmakers in Pittsburgh, Ruby for Good in Virginia, and Abstractions II in Pittsburgh.
Next month, I’m attending Strange Loop in St. Louis.

Attending conferences can be very expensive. For example, the ticket to attend Ruby Conf this year is $400. The late ticket to Strange Loop is $800 now the conference is less than a month away. When you add flights and hotels for the ones that’s not in your town, it can easily be over $1000 dollars.
That’s a lot of money, especially for students.

I didn’t pay for any of the conference tickets that I’ve attended nor the flights or hotels. I will share how I did it.

I applied for scholarships.

Sometimes they are called opportunity scholarships or diversity tickets.
There are a few ways I’ve found scholarships.
First, if you are not on Twitter, get on it.
I found out about React Conf and Ruby Conf on Twitter. I saw someone tweet about the scholarships, I applied and I got them.
Follow @DiversifyTechCo. Her website is https://www.diversifytech.co/. She posts so many opportunities. You can probably search for something like “tech conference scholarships” yourself, but her list is so amazing I bet you’ll find conferences you are interested.
Join local meetup groups and their slack channels. I found out about Google Women Techmakers from someone in a local tech meetup group.
If there is a specific conference you are interested, follow their Twitter handle. See if they have a website with scholarship opportunities. If you don’t see anything about scholarships, ask them or check often. I found out about Ruby for Good when I attended Ruby Conf. I followed and checked their website regularly for a few months until I saw that they offer scholarships.

Some scholarships offer just an entrance admission to their conference. Some offers an admission, flights, and hotels. Ruby for Good offered housing, food and the conference ticket. I drove for about five hours to get to the venue. Strange loop offered a conference ticket, flight, hotel, and I got to pick one workshop to attend. They are all different. You need to find what works for you and apply!

There is usually an application with questions like “Why do you want to attend this conference?”, “tell us if you belong to an under-represented group (or groups).” or “How might attending the conference affect your professional and/or life paths?”. You can probably tell by now, but I’m not a native English speaker or the best writer. I didn’t let that stop me. I spent time, and I was honest.

Ruby Conf and Rails Conf both run by Ruby Central and they offer guides. Before the conference, they send you a questionnaire to figure out what your goals are at the conference and they pair you with a guide who can help you achieve the goals. This was amazing! Ruby Conf is a three-day conference with multi tracks. My guide helped me pick talks to attend that will fit my skill level, introduced me to people including Saron Yitbarek from CodeNewbie and the father of Ruby, Matz!! I can go on about what an incredible experience Ruby Conf is, but we don’t have all day.

Another way to attend a conference without spending too much money is to apply for a volunteer position.

So much goes into conferences. Planning, of course, but the day of event as well. Abstractions II offered a free conference ticket to volunteers and in return, they asked volunteers to put in at least six hours of their time. They had a sign up sheet for all kinds of duties such as scanning the entry wristband, monitoring the speaker room, working at a T-shirt desk, being a gopher and etc. I believe Ruby Conf was offering volunteer tickets at much discounted rate in exchange for a few hours of your time at the conference. 
I won a scholarship to attend Abstractions II, but I also volunteered. I highly recommend doing this. I was happy that I was able to give something back. I met so many people volunteering and it was a great networking opportunity. 


* Attending a conference

Attending tech conferences can be intimidating. 
I made a list of things that may help people who are going to their first conference.
Wear something comfortable. Most people are in T-shirts and jeans. I usually wear t-shirts (I have so many conference t-shirts!), long pants and bring something with long sleeves even in the middle of summer. You won’t be moving a lot, and I often feel venues are too cold. Just pack something in your bag in case it’s cold. 
You don’t need to carry your computer around unless you have to. Have a notepad and a pen to take notes.
If you are attending a big conference with multiple tracks, pick talks you really want to attend. Keep them in a spreadsheet beforehand. Big conferences get overwhelming fast. I mark ones I really don’t want to miss and ones I want to attend, but ok to miss. If I meet someone or want to change plans or just need a break, I’m ok to miss those talks.

Pack a water bottle. They usually have some water stations, but I hate wasting cups. having my own bottle has been one of my favorite conference hack. If you are flying, empty your water bottle before the security.
Find a conference buddy/buddies! 
My first big tech conference to attend was React Conf 2018. I was a bit nervous going by myself. My goal before going was to find a conference buddy.
React conf and Ruby conf announced the scholarship winners around the same time and noticed there was a woman who won both scholarships like me. I reached out to her via slack or Twitter and found out she was a Flatiron alum and React Conf was her first conference to attend. We started chatting more, and we were conference buddies at React Conf and Ruby Conf. Having a conference buddy is great. React conf was a single track conference. There is only one room and everyone sits in the same room all day. We sat together most of the time and we always had someone to sit with for meal times. 
It’s ok to take a break. Don’t feel you have to be at the conference all day, especially if it goes more than a day. I love attending conferences, but it’s exhausting. A lot of conferences record their talks and post them later. Fight your FOMO and take a break.
Make sure you have some space in your bag. You usually get at least one conference t-shirt. Then you get swags from different booths such as more t-shirts, water bottles, socks, stickers, etc.
Join non-technical fun stuff. Some conferences have fiber arts circles, board game tables, craft tables, Karaoke and such. This is a great way to meet people with all skill levels. I knit and crochet and I’ve been bringing my knitting project to conferences. I feel a lot less intimidated joining in to fiber arts circles than just a table with a bunch of engineers. I know at least we all like fiber arts and people are usually talking about their hobbies and not something super technical. At the last conference, I met a senior software engineering manager from a big company and had a nice conversation. I met a front end engineer, and she offered me to pair program when I need help with front end stuff. At Ruby for Good, I had a great time playing board games with engineers at all skill levels. 

I’ve been very fortunate to attend all the conferences in the past year. The things I leaned and connections I made have been incredible assets to my coding journey. I hope this guide helps other students. If you have any questions, find me on Slack or Twitter @codingmamakaz.
