This project felt like it came out of nowhere!!!

I knew there was a project at the end of the Ruby part of the course. I also knew I was very close to it, but then I had struggled with the labs right before the CLI project and it made me feel like I wasn’t going anywhere. I really liked Ruby and I even thought I was pretty good at it until I reached the object oriented Ruby part of the course. I struggled the most with understanding when to use attr_accessor, object relationships, and how to use Nokogiri.

There was so much information and so many things to consider for the project, I felt overwhelmed. My task was to build an application that provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) to an external data source. The CLI would be composed of an Object Oriented Ruby application. 
I was recently chosen to be part of a great beta program with amazing coaches and fabulous classmates who are also going through their own projects. The program pairs me with my classmates to talk about what we are struggling with. I got to see other classmates having to go through the same challenges as myself and share tips on the slack channel. The project is my own, but I wasn’t alone in it and it really comforted me and pushed me forward.

One of the challenges that I didn’t expect was finding the right site to scrape information from. I had a few ideas for apps, but finding a scrapable site that gives me the right information was almost as hard as the project itself, and to be honest, I’m not completely happy with the site I found. I will keep looking for a perfect site that will give me all the information I want and I will make another application when I find one.

One of the gains that I didn’t expect was that I got so much better at using pry. Before the project, I was using pry, but not as much as I should have. My debugging style was like throwing rocks at a moving target in the dark. Now I have seen the light! I can see where my target is and the target is still. I’m so much better at using pry. This makes debugging so much easier.

When I started learning to code, so many people told me to build something. Anything. They all said that’s the way you learn the most. It is true. I learned so much in the past week and a half that I spent on my project. Now I understand when to use attr_accessor, have much better idea of object relationships and I know how to use Nokogiri. I’m happy to say that I love Ruby again and I feel like I AM good at it!!
