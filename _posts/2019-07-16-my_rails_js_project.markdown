I just finished building my app to meet all the requirements for Rails and JavaScript project for Flatiron School. To be honest, I was very nervous going into this project. I felt like things weren’t clicking quite right in my head and that I didn’t understand JavaScript well enough. 
I’m pleasantly surprised how good I feel about it now. I learn so much when I build something of my own, get so excited with new skills I’m learning and makes me want to keep building.

With this project, we use the Rails app we built for the previous project assessment.
The requirements were: 

1. Must translate JSON responses from your Rails app into JavaScript Model Objects using either ES6 class or constructor syntax. The Model Objects must have at least one method on the prototype. (Formatters work really well for this.)
2. Must render at least one index page (index resource - 'list of things') via JavaScript and an Active Model Serialization JSON Backend.
3. Must render at least one show page (show resource - 'one specific thing') via JavaScript and an Active Model Serialization JSON Backend.
4. Your Rails application must dynamically render on the page at least one serialized 'has_many' relationship through JSON using JavaScript.
5. Must use your Rails application to render a form for creating a resource that is submitted dynamically and displayed through JavaScript and JSON without a page refresh.

I watched a few of the suggested videos for this project before starting. I found these three videos especially helpful: https://youtu.be/Yd0nH9CWWfo https://youtu.be/oHPM0ekV7zQ https://youtu.be/oHPM0ekV7zQ 

Those videos really helped me understand the flow of code and actions. Understanding the flow helped me with debugging as well. Speaking of debugging, I spent most of time in Chrome DevTools with this project. Before this project, I didn’t really get DevTools. I didn’t realize it's like `binding.pry` on steroids!! Here is a helpful video on how to get started with DevTools:  https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/ I’m so happy now I know how to use it and can’t wait to learn more tricks! 
Another thing that helped me debugging was `console.log`. I put something like `console.log('js file loading...')` to see if my event listners are working and  `console.log('link clicked!!')` to make sure my event handlers are working.

In my last blog post, I wrote about How I set up my rails project. We started the previous project from scratch and it was a lot of steps just to get started. It was quite simple with this one since we were building on top of the previous projects, but I want to mention a few things hoping this will help someone who stumbled upon this blog. 

1. Create [duplicate](https://help.github.com/en/articles/duplicating-a-repository) or branch the repo of the previous Rails project.

2.  Add ` gem 'active_model_serializers'` and `gem 'jquery-rails'` in your gemfile.
3.  Add `//= require jquery` in application.js and make sure `//= require rails-ujs` and `//= require_tree .` are included in there too. 

That’s it. Pretty simple. I had an issue that my reload was behaving irregularly. After reading other students having issues with it, I decided to [delete turbolinks](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38649550/how-to-disable-turbolinks-in-rails-5 ) 

This project really made me realize how far I’ve come. I definitely notice my debugging skills and googling skills have gotten so much stronger. I can’t wait to pass the assessment and move to React and do more fun stuff!!
