Creating an application from scratch can be intimidating. I’ve been working on labs at Flatiron school where the environment is set up for students. I’m familiar with forking and cloning labs to start, but I’ve only started projects from scratch a handful times. I wrote down steps I took to get my rails project started. There are probably different ways to do this, but I’m writing this to show how I set up mine. I know this will help future me and hopefully some others.


First, make sure you are in the folder you want to create your app in. I always manage to forget to be in the right folder to start.
Run `gem install rails`.
Check the ruby version by running `ruby -v` if you have [Ruby RVM](https://rvm.io/). You can check the versions you have by running `rvm list`. You can change and use a different version (let’s say I want to use ruby-2.5.3) by running `rvm use ruby-2.5.3`.

Generate a new rails application by running `rails new name_of_your_app`. Make sure you change name_of_your_app to the name you picked for your app.
Check your gemfile to see you have all the gems you want to get started. It seems the default Gemfile doesn’t come with pry. If you want to use pry instead of byebug, add `gem ‘pry’` in your Gemfile, and then run `bundle install`.

With my last project, I decided to deploy my app on Heroku after I built the app to meet the project requirements (I still plan to add features to the app or build it with Rails instead of Sinatra), and it was a nightmare!!!!! In Heroku docs, it says 
>“We highly recommend using PostgreSQL during development. Maintaining parity between your development and deployment environments prevents subtle bugs from being introduced because of differences between your environments.”

This time, I decided  to use Postgres as my database and set up my app with Heroku from the beginning. I followed this [instruction page](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails5) on Heroku as well as [this video](https://youtu.be/qniGJMH7Weo). I couldn’t believe how easy it was this time around!! 


Before you fire up the rails server, you can create the database by running  `rake db:create`.
To startup the Rails server, make sure that you are in the root of your application in the terminal and run  `rails s`.
Then go to http://localhost:3000/  in your browser, and you can check to see if it’s working properly in the browser. You should see this screen says "Yay! You’re on Rails!".

Now you have set your local environment, head over to Github. 

Login to your Github account and click on the + at the upper right says ‘New repository’. Enter your project name and description(optional) and click on **Create repository**.

Go back to your terminal and run `git add .`.
Then run `git commit -m “initial commit”` to get your commit ready to push it to github. “Initial commit” is the convention for the first commit message, but it can be anything.
Then go back to github and copy the two lines of code from where it says “…or push an existing repository from the command line.

Paste those two lines of code to your command line to connect github to your local project and push your files to github.
Refresh your github page and you should see your new repository there.

Voila! Now your local files and github are connected, you can start building your project. Don’t forget to commit often! On the project page of Flatiron, it says 
> Good rule of thumb is to commit every 3-7 mins of actual coding time. Most of your commits should have under 15 lines of code and a 2 line commit is perfectly acceptable. 

Good luck and have fun!!
