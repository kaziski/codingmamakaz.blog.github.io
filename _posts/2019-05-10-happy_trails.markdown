Sinatra project is the second project we work on at Flatiron School.
We have to build an Build a CRUD, MVC application using Sinatra and ActiveRecord. It has to use multiple models and has to have at least one `:has_many` relationship on a user model and one `:belongs_to` relationship on another model. It has to have user accounts, and users must be able to sign up, sign in, and sign out. It has to validate uniqueness of user login attribute (username or email). Once logged in, a user must have the ability to create, read, update and destroy the resource that `:belongs_to` user and we have to ensure that users can edit and delete only their own resources.

Ever since I started coding, I've had this idea for an app. A social platform for friends to share information about trails they visited. I’ve always loved hiking. Now I’m a mother of two little ones, I love taking them to the woods and enjoy the nature. I wanted to create an app that let a person like me and friends keep track of trails they visited with some useful information such as “is there a bathroom?”, “cell phone reception?”, “Is it near the water?”, “Can we play in the creek?”, “Is it dog friendly?” and so on.  

I thought this project was a perfect opportunity to start my dream app. It would have three models: users, trails and categories. A user :has_many trails, and a trail belongs_to a user. Users must be able to sign up, sign in, and sign out. A user can create, read, update and delete trails that belong to the user. 

I was excited to start the project, but then I realized I didn’t know how to plan my project. Then someone tweeted this article https://medium.com/@TheDickWard/workflow-how-i-build-an-app-da1deb0e91b1?hss_channel=tw-702354494 [](http://)


This couldn’t come at better time.

This really stuck with me and I kept this at heart while building my project. I had so much fun seeing my app grow as I added more and more functionalities and it was so much easier to catch bugs as I built one by one.

The author of the article uses Trello board to track and organize work. I decided to try and LOVED IT!! I loved moving card from my to-do list to done list.
Is my to-do list all clear? Actually no. It meets the project requirements, but there are so many features I want to add. 

Right now, anyone can sign up and see everyone’s trail information. I want to make it so trail information can only be shared amongst friends. I want to add a map feature, a messaging feature and also somehow help everyone enjoy hikes safely by adding information to the closest police station and/or maybe friends can vote on safety level of trails. Eventually, I want to create a mobile version as well. I’m so excited how this project is turing out. I’ve been wanting to create something that helps me and my friends. I’ve been looking to start a project that I can keep working on and add features as I continue to learn. Happy Trails to me!!
